This repo consist of Final project I did for the Operating system class for fall 2017. This project involved:
1.Development of Image processing server which would recive an Color image from the client ,use openCV based server to convert the image 
  from colour to greyscale and then the image is displayed back to client.
2.The server is multi threaded thus it can accept more than one request concurrently.
3.we use network sockets to connect a client to a server and file transfer protocol to transfer data from client to server.
